-- Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse.
-- Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time â€” each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse.

-- REASONING: this is a listing of all those who entered the courthouse prior to 10:15am on July 28th
-- NOTE: Query has also been sanitized of those who have exited before that time to reduce scope
